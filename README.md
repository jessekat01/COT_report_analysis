## How the Commitments of Traders (COT) Report Works

Originating in 1924, the COT report was initially an annual publication and became a monthly report in 1962. It switched to a bi-weekly format in the 1990s and has been published weekly since 2000. The report provides data compiled on Tuesday and verified on Wednesday, with release every Friday.

The report visualizes market dynamics and is intended to help traders understand market positioning. However, it does not categorize individual traders' positions due to confidentiality.

## Special Considerations

The COT report is a core data source for traders and academic research on pricing trends. Despite its importance, it has limitations, such as aggregated data that may not accurately reflect individual market positions. Critics suggest publishing more detailed data to improve transparency, though such changes seem unlikely. Despite these limitations, the COT remains a valuable tool for understanding market trends.
